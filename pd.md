Tech Stack:
FastAPI: For the backend API.
React: For the frontend.
MongoDB: For the database.
Steps to Build the Recipe Manager:
Backend (FastAPI):

Set Up FastAPI:

Install FastAPI and Uvicorn.
Create a basic FastAPI application.

Database Integration:

Set up MongoDB and connect it to your FastAPI application using an ODM like Motor or Pydantic models.

User Authentication:

Implement user registration and login endpoints.
Use JWT tokens for session management.

Recipe Endpoints:

Create endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting recipes.
Implement search and filter functionality.

Favorites:

Create endpoints for marking recipes as favorites and retrieving favorite recipes.
Frontend (React):

Set Up React:

Create a new React application using Create React App or Vite.

Install Redux Toolkit and RTK Query:

Install Redux Toolkit and RTK Query to manage state and API calls.

Set Up Redux Store:

Configure the Redux store to include the RTK Query API service.

Create API Service with RTK Query:

Define API endpoints using RTK Query to handle CRUD operations, user authentication, and favorites.

Set Up Provider in React:

Wrap your application with the Redux Provider to make the store available throughout your app.

Create Components:

Use the hooks generated by RTK Query to fetch and manipulate data in your components.
Implement components for displaying the recipe list, recipe details, and forms for adding/editing recipes.
Implement user authentication forms (sign up, log in).

API Integration:

Use RTK Query to connect the React frontend with the FastAPI backend.
Handle user authentication and store JWT tokens.

State Management:

Use React's Context API or a state management library like Redux to manage the application state.

Search and Filter:

Implement search and filter functionality on the frontend using RTK Query.

Favorites:

Allow users to mark recipes as favorites and view their favorite recipes using RTK Query.
